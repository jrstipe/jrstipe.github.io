				<h4>Perch wants 40 points</h4>
				<p>The versatile midfielder made the 300th appearance of his career in Saturday's 1-1 draw at The Hawthorns and thinks Newcastle started to make amends after their awful derby defeat to Sunderland the previous week. But although United now only need one win to reach Perch's target, they dropped two places to 16th in the Premier League because of Sunderland's win over Everton and Stoke's victory at QPR. They are six points ahead of 18th-placed Wigan but Perch said: "We still want to hit that 40-point mark to be sure. Then we know we will be safe. We just hope we keep playing well and picking up points away from home, and make sure our home form is a bit better.</p>

We have got a good enough team, we have got good enough players in the squad to make sure we don't go down.</p>
