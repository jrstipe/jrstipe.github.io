				<h4>Liverpool FC today announced in Bangkok that they will be launching an official website in Thailand for supporters ahead of the clubâ€™s visit in July.</h4>
				<p>The Reds will take on the Thailand national team at Bangkok's Rajamangala National Stadium on Sunday 28th July and as part of a campaign of fan engagement, the new official LFC website will go live in June. The website will populated locally in Bangkok in Thai language and as well as covering all the latest news coming out of Anfield, Melwood and the Academy, exclusive local content will be created to appeal directly to our Thai supporters. Today's announcement about the new website - made by Matthew Baxter, LFC's chief media officer, at the Golden Tulip hotel in Bangkok - is the latest development as part of a dedicated programme of fan engagement that the Reds are conducting in Thailand. In late 2012, LFC launched an official Thai-language magazine and Twitter feed - allowing supporters to directly engage with the club in local language. The new website will be followed by a dedicated Thai-language Facebook page, an acknowledgement of just how popular the Reds are in Thailand on the world's biggest social media platform. Liverpool has over 400,000 followers on Facebook in Bangkok alone, more than double any other city in the world. The club are also in discussions with broadcasters in Thailand to enable supporters to be able to access LFC TV next season</p>

				<h4>This story has been reproduced from today's media. It does not necessarily represent the position of Liverpool Football Club.</h4>
				<p>Despite the Premier League season still having a month or so left for this campaign, Liverpool's preparations for an assault on the top four next year are already well underway, with one of the main facets of the club's summer set to be a trip to Australia and Thailand on a preseason tour. Last year, with newly appointed boss Brendan Rodgers at the helm, Liverpool headed to the U.S. and Canada for a three-match visit while they continued their fitness work and had the manager assess his new players. This time round it will be an altogether longer trip for the Reds, as they head to Australia for the first time ever, before making their way to Thailand as well. Here are all the details on the Reds' summer visits...</p>

				<h4>Seniors to Travel</h4>
				<p>Judging by the promotional videos, interviews and general excitement, fans in Australia and Thailand can expect a full senior squad to head away on the tour. Of course, as a preseason event, it is likely that some of the most promising youngsters will also get to travel, for increased numbers in training and to see how they cope in a first-team environment. In summer of 2012, the likes of Ryan McLaughlin, Suso, Andre Wisdom, Conor Coady, Jordan Ibe and Brad Smith all joined the senior players on the U.S. tour. A page dedicated to the current first-team players has been put up on the tour website-which will presumably be updated nearer the time to reflect any potential incoming or outgoing transfers, with the window opening some time before the Reds head South. There is only one major international tournament this summer, the Confederations Cup, which means that there is the possibility of some Reds being involved in action for their nations. Philippe Coutinho and Lucas Leiva (Brazil), Sebastian Coates and Luis Suarez (Uruguay), Fabio Borini (Italy) and Pepe Reina (Spain) all stand some chance of being involved, though not all are regulars at present in their respective international squads. The Confederations Cup ends on June 30, which would mean around three weeks' rest for the players before joining up with the team to fly to Australia. For second-choice goalkeeper Brad Jones, it will be a return to his home country when the Reds head to Australia; Jones was born in Perth and was capped three times for his nation at international level.
