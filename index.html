					<h4>Glen Johnson's take on the current coaching staff</h4>
					<p>Glen Johnson believes Liverpool are enjoying a better season than last term, despite the club winning the Carling Cup in 2011-12, with the right-back hailing the progress of the side in Brendan Rodgers' first campaign.</p>

					<h3>The Legendary Starting 11</h3>
					<p>
						<ol>
	<li>GK - Pepe Reina: No need to explain here, he is world class and to be honest plays just as a crucial role in creating goals than saving them :) </li>

	<li>RB - Martin Kelly: This guy I believe has stepped up to the role of Right Back and I would be personally confident in him being Liverpool's full time RB.</li>

	<li>RCB - Martin Skrtel: Without a doubt this man has been the best defender of the season and has one of the best centre back pairings and connection with Daniel Agger a must have in our starting XI.</li>

	<li>LCB - Daniel Agger: Top class defender and like Reina has the threat of creating goals as well as stopping them.</li>

	<li>LB - Jose Enrique: Finally a solution to a world class, injury free left back, bargain of the season!</li>

	<li>CDM - Lucas Leiva: Its clear that Liverpool are missing this talented individual and I hope he comes into next season fired up and ready to lead Liverpool in the heart of midfield to glory!. But most importantly for me he completes our defensive set of players as I'm aiming for 5 defensive players and 5 atttacking players with the exclusion of Reina.</li>

	<li>LM - Stewart Downing: The man has finally hit form and it is clear that his pairing and understanding with Enrique is starting to solidify and in my opinion he is an asset to Liverpool and a solution to past yrs with wingers. </li>

	<li>RM - Glen Johnson: For me I see the best and most talented of Glen Johnson not when he is defending but when he is crossing the ball or dribbling the ball down the right flank and curling in a screamer of a goal like our carling cup victory over Chelsea :D I think he is our solution to right midfield rather than someone like Henderson who is clearly someone who should play in the centre of the pitch, most likely as a student of Gerrard in CAM.</li>

	<li>CAM - Steven Gerrard: His display against Everton...... enough said really. Playing him deep in midfield is just a waste of his talent really and surely you saw how many chances he created and scored! He is for me our third striker because I think we have two top quality strikers but different but eventually will be a top partnership</li>

	<li>RS - Luis Suarez: Let's just hope Suarez stays with us and doesnt go to PSG because he is invaluable to our squad and creates loads of chances, he just needs to work on his finishing.</li>

	<li>LS - Daniel Sturridge: The new Star of LFC with his speed and foot skills, he is lethal and fun to watch.</li>
